# Diabetes-prediction
That's great you're working on a diabetes prediction model! A good README file is key to making your GitHub repository easy to understand and use. Here's a template for a README file you can use, tailored to your project.

Diabetes Prediction Model
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting diabetes. The project explores the performance of several classification models, including Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, to identify the most effective model for this task.

üéØ Project Goal
The primary goal of this project was to build and compare different machine learning models to predict the onset of diabetes based on a given dataset. The project's emphasis was on model performance comparison rather than extensive data preprocessing.

üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
Data Loading: The dataset was loaded directly without any prior data cleaning.

Data Standardization: The data was standardized using a Standard Scaler to prepare it for model training.

Model Training: The following models were trained and evaluated:

Logistic Regression

Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Random Forest Classifier

XGBoost Classifier

Performance Evaluation: The models were evaluated based on their performance metrics to determine which one was most suitable for the prediction task.

üìà Key Findings
After training and evaluating all the models, the Random Forest Classifier was found to be the best-performing model for this dataset.
